# Christmas List Mailer Code

This is the code for reading the spreadsheet of our Christmas List for work and sending out the emails to the appropriate parties and from the respective agent. There is an HTML (not-included in this project) that was used as the body of the email that has an embedded link in an image that sends the recipient to our pdf Christmas Card.

Sensitive information has been redacted. This project is now complete and was successfully used to send our the companies Christmas Cards.

It is written in C# with ASP.Net only being used for the ever-so-satisfying button press to run the code.

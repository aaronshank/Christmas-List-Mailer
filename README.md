# Christmas List Mailer Code

This is the code for reading the spreadsheet of our Christmas List for work and sending out the emails to the appropriate parties and from the respective agent.

Sensitive information has been redacted. This project is not complete, but I will be updating this as the project continues.

It is written in C# with ASP.Net only being used for the ever-so-satisfying button press to run the code.
